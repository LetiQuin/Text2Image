Algorithm to Convert an Image to Text Representation [DRAFT]

Input:

    Image (in the form of pixel data, or a grid of luminosity values)

Output:

    Text-based image representation using "X" for dark pixels and space (" ") for light pixels.

Steps:

    Load the Image:
        Convert the image into a grayscale format, where each pixel is represented by a luminosity value (e.g., 0 for black and 255 for white).

    python

def load_image(image_path):
    image = load_image_as_grayscale(image_path)  # Load image in grayscale
    return image

Define the Grid:

    Create a grid based on the image's pixel resolution (width and height).

python

def create_grid(image):
    height, width = image.shape  # Get the dimensions of the image
    grid = [[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]  # Initialize grid
    return grid

Map Pixels to Grid:

    Iterate through each pixel in the image and assign a value based on its luminosity:
        Use a threshold to determine whether the pixel is "dark" or "light".
        Replace dark pixels (below the threshold) with "X" and light pixels with a space (" ").

python

def map_pixels_to_grid(image, grid, threshold=128):
    height, width = image.shape
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            luminosity = image[y, x]
            if luminosity < threshold:
                grid[y][x] = 'X'  # Dark pixel
            else:
                grid[y][x] = ' '  # Light pixel
    return grid

Maintain Aspect Ratio:

    Ensure that the aspect ratio is preserved when generating the text image.
    This means that the gridâ€™s width-to-height ratio should match that of the original image.

python

def maintain_aspect_ratio(grid, original_aspect_ratio):
    # Adjust grid or characters to maintain aspect ratio if needed
    return grid

Generate Text-Based Image:

    Convert the grid of "X"s and spaces into a string where each row of the grid represents a line of text.

python

def generate_text_image(grid):
    text_image = '\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])
    return text_image

Display or Save Text Image:

    You can print the text image directly or save it to a file for later use.

python

    def save_text_image(text_image, output_path):
        with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
            file.write(text_image)
